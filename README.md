# Space Instagram

The script downloads images from spacex and hubble image libraries. Then it publishes it to Instagram.

### How to install

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

use .env to set instagram username and password:
```
INSTAGRAM_LOGIN=yourlogin
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```


### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
